# odin-etch-a-sketch
A browser version of something between a sketchpad and Etch-a-Sketch

## Description
This project is meant to test (and improve) my knowledge of the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, specifically DOM manipulation. 
It will also test one of the most important skills every developer must have: the ability to Google and learn things quickly.
