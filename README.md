# odin-etch-a-sketch
A browser version of something between a sketchpad and Etch-a-Sketch

## Description
This project is meant to test (and improve) my knowledge of the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, specifically DOM manipulation. 
It will also test one of the most important skills every developer must have: the ability to Google and learn things quickly. 

## How to play
When you first open the website, JavaScript will automatically create 16x16 grid. To draw something on it, you just need to move your mouse and hover over certain grid cells. The default color is white, but you can always change it by using the color pallette to the left of the sketchpad.

You can also change the size of the grid to be 32x32 or 48x48 by clicking the button "Grid" above the sketchpad. The grid size can't be bigger than 99x99. 

If you are bored, you can turn on the rainbow mode using the appropriate button.
